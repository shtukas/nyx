The principal design idea of CoreData is that we refer to specific storage units by a single string, called a Core Date Reference String, or just _reference string_. Note that mutations of the data may result in the string being updated, in any case the holder should always assume that an edit results in the string being updated.

reference strings categories:

    - "null" (when the node doesn't have one, for instance navigation nodes)

    - "unique-string:#{uniquestring}""

    - "text:#{nhash}"
      The fragment is the named hash of the text in DatablobStore

    - "aion-point:#{nhash}"
      The nhash is the named hash of the root of the aion hierarchy

    - "url:#{nhash}"
      The nhash is the named hash of the url in the DatablobStore

    - "file:#{nhash}"
      We do not specifically create those but we have them in stock, 
      we got them from NxTodos when we migrated, from Nx113 to CoreData 
      The nhash points at an object of the form
        {
            "dottedExtension" => String
            "nhash"           => String
            "parts"           => Array[String]
        }
