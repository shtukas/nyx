Fx35 are a type of nodes of the Nyx Network. (Introduced in August 2025). Unlike their Nx27 counterpart they do not carry a payload. They entirely exist in the file system and their payload is the directory in which they are. They are copied to but are not editable in the database. When an edit is made, it's made either by editing the file, manually or from the cli, but the instance on disk is updated first before a copy is put in the database.

Fx35
    uuid        : String
    mikuType    : "Fx35"
    datetime    : DateTime Iso 8601 UTC Zulu
    description : String or null [1]
    linkeduuids : Array[String]
    notes       : Array[NxNote]
    tags        : Array[String]

[1] If null the description is the name of the parent directory

One creates one of them using the cli and creating and moving the file. We do not have a maintenance process to scan the file system and update them. That kind of update is done as part of looking for them. See code for details.

They are stored as json files with extension `.nyx-fx35.json`. If a unique file in a directory, we can call it `Fx35.nyx-fx35.json`.
