[1] When this is true it means that the node is the delegate of a file on the file system. Such a node has its description derived from the name of the diretory where it is and cannot have a payload. Accessing it moves you to the filesystem location.

They are created by moving a NxFS42 file which has two lines the uuid, followed by the description. If there is no second line, then the description is the name of the parent directory.
