Unless otherwise specified the data of the key / value store are strings. unxitime is a float.

Orbital file names follow a strict structure

<main>.nyxnode

The ~/Galaxy/DataHub/Nyx/Index directory contains individual files, each named after and containing an orbital uuid.

    "uuid"        : String
    "mikuType"    : "NxNode"
    "unixtime"    : Integer # defaults to creation but that be set 
                         # to the most contextually relevant time for that 
                         # particular node

}

Nodes have additional objects that are attached to them, we refer to that collection as the "sphere". The types are NxCoreDataPayload, NxTaxonomy, NxNote.
