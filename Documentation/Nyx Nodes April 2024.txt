We are moving to a new set of nyx nodes.

Type 1:
    filename    : name.nyx1-location.trace.json
    content type: JSON
    purpose     : exists in one version in the file system. It refers to a location in Galaxy and that location is the directory in which it resides.
    location    : in the directory that they refer to

Type 2:
    filename: name.nyx2-data-carrier.trace.sqlite3
    contents: metadata and binary blobs
    purpose : immutable data carrier.

Type 3:
    filename    : name.nyx3-navigation.trace.json
    content type: JSON
    purpose     : navigation nodes
    location    : anywhere in Galaxy, but their default position is going to be the timeline.
