With the redesign we did on June 9th (2023), the Nyx types (and in particular their representation on disk) are simplier.

Conceptually things are also simple:

Nyx is a network of nodes and the link between them. 
Each node carries the links to its neighbours on the network.

The common Interface between all nodes is
    - uuid          : String
    - unixtime      : Float
    - datetime      : DateTime Iso 8601 UTC Zulu
    - description   : String
    - linkeduuids   : Array[String]
    - taxonomy      : Array[NxTaxonomy]
    - notes         : Array[NxNote]
    - tags          : Array[String]
    - toString
    - program # the equivalent of the old landing


- Node types are
    - Nx101 
        The old legacy data carrier, some of them aion-points) that live in 
        DataHub/Cubes

    - NxAvaldi
        Cube files that exist on the Galaxy hierarchy, define a node and their 
        contents is the contents of the folder where they reside.
