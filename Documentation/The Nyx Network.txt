General Principles:
    1. Nyx is a network of nodes and the links between them. 
    2. Each node carries the links to its neighbours on the network.

The common Interface between all nodes is
    - uuid          : String
    - unixtime      : Float
    - datetime      : DateTime Iso 8601 UTC Zulu
    - description   : String
    - linkeduuids   : Array[String]
    - notes         : Array[NxNote]
    - tags          : Array[String]
    - toString      : String
    - program       # the equivalent of the old landing
    - searchTraces  : Array[NxST1]

- Node types are
    - Nx101 
        The old legacy data carrier, some of them aion-points) that live in 
        DataHub/Cubes

    - NxAvaldi
        Cube files that exist on the Galaxy hierarchy, define a node and their 
        contents is the contents of the folder where they reside.
