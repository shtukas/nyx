Nyx nodes are implemented as items, the Sx0138 datatype, and items are, on disk, immutable files called marbles that contain all the data related to the node, including how it links to other nodes.

Q: Why immutable ?
A: Because we sync the file system between several machines, and having a content addresses storage makes that synchronization unambiguous.

Marbles are sqlite3 files, with two tables

sqlite> .schema
CREATE TABLE object (recorduuid string, recordTime float, attributeName string, attributeValue blob);
CREATE TABLE datablobs (key string, datablob blob);

Nyx marble files have the suffix .nyx17
