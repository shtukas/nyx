Somebody once asked this question on the internet: _I am wondering if it is possible in a reasonably convenient way to store files in the form of a graph (in the mathematical sense). That would mean that any file can be connected to multiple other files or "directories", and such a directory would be a node in the graph but not a file._

My answer can be found here: [nyx.md](./Documentation/nyx.md)
