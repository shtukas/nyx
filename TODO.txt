[done] Design a new .nyx-blade
[done] Look like we already have blades, so I need to rename that.
[in progress] Implement the basic interface for nyx blades
[] Migrate to nyx blades
[] To be able to drop a blade at a location.
[] To be able to move a blade to the desktop for manual relocation.

Nyx blades are the elements of the Nyx Network which hold the data related to a particular node. It's a sqlite file with a single table that holds the node meta data and the binary blobs.

create table blade (_key_ TEXT primary key, _data_ BLOB);

The node is stored in against _key_ set to "node" as a JSON encoded string. The other elements in the table should be the data blobs, against their nhash.
